Kegstarter - For enlightened offices
====================================

This project grew out of a "need" to track the office Kegerator in a
slightly better way. The goal is to have something simple, but still
have it be a good learning project for people starting out in Django /
Rest / `M*` js framework


Goals
=====
* Track how much money is in various keg buckets
* Track what kegs are on the list of "Buy?" w/ cost & voting
* Track what's currently in the kegerator, what tap it's on, etc.


Disclaimers
===========
Drink responsibly.

This is a lighthearted project, loosely based on the kickstarter idea,
and is not meant for commercial purposes.
